Hello sir/madam,

This is Prashanth(nthprasha443@gmail.com).

Here i wrote a c program to list out the missing and unused header.

In this file i covered some important header files such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, conio.h, math.h, time.h, string.h, and ctype,h. there are so many header files available but lack of time i used these headers only. in these headers i covered all important inbuilt functions. 

This file is created using c programming, i wrote in my own idea.

The procedure is whenever we give yyy.c file it converts it into string then check listed keyords present or not, then if present but not used it returns this specific header file does not used. if header is used but not present it returns header is missing. at final stage you can view the result.

Thats it. 

I am willing to start my career in embedded domain. so please consider me.

Thank you.
